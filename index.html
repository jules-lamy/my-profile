				<h2>Basketball 🏀</h2>
				<p>
					I played basketball for 14 years so I grew up with the sport. What I like about this sport is above all the collective aspect and the fact that the game has a very fast rhythm. I also watch the NBA, sometimes in replay because of the schedules, and I support the Utah Jazz especially for their collective game but because one of my favourite players, the French Rudy Gobert, plays there.

				<h2>Formula 1 🏎️</h2>
				<p>
					I remember, when I was a kid, Sundays watching the cars driving on the circuits. I was a fan of Schumacher, like many people back then, and I watched with great admiration. After a short break, I have been back to it for two years now and I am a fan again. My favourite drivers are Pierre Gasly and Charles Leclerc, who are the future of F1 for me.

				<h2>Movies 🍿</h2>
				<p>
					One night, when I was young, my father and I decided to watch Star Wars together. Since then I have never left the world of movies. I even took the Audiovisual Cinema option in my baccalaureate. I have always been more attracted to films than books.

				<h2>Dancing 🕺🏻</h2>
				<p>
					I love music and especially dance. I like to move to the sound of music and to go wild on the dancefloor. I did a year and a half of Hip-Hop and last year I did salsa during my university exchange.
